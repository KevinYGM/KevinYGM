### Hello My name is Kevin Y González M. 👋

### Front-End Developer | React | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | GIT | Informatics Engineer 👨🏾‍💻

I´m a person very proactive, friendly, very
organized and responsible. 

I have a lot of experience in work
related to soft skills, such as sales, however,
I am currently deeply interested in entering the
world of the Technological Industry, for which I have prepared
as a Frontend Developer, with a variety of courses and projects
especially with React.
